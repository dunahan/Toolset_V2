# Toolset_V2
Changes to the appearance of the Neverwinter Nights Toolset<br/>
<br/>
Exported delphi form files from the NWN EE Toolset, that can be viewed/edited by using the DFM Editor from Michal Mutl www(dot)mitec(dot)cz. With this tool, every change can be viewed during the process.<br/>
<br/>
To get them imported back in the EXE, you need the ResourceHacker by Angus Johnson www(dot)angusj(dot)com.<br/>
<br/>
Also what I found useful: http://www.fw-web.de/dfmedit/help/Forms_en.htm. Even when it's for an older version of DFM Editor.<br/>
