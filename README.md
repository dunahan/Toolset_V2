Visibly changes on the Neverwinter Nights Toolset

Exported delphi form files from the NWN EE Toolset, that can be viewed/edited by using the DFM Editor from Michal Mutl www(dot)mitec(dot)cz.
To get them imported back in the EXE, you need the ResourceHacker by Angus Johnson www(dot)angusj(dot)com

Also what I found useful: http://www.fw-web.de/dfmedit/help/Forms_en.htm
Even when it's for an older version of DFM Editor.
